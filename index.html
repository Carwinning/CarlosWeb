                <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio!</h1>
                <p>I am an MIT Undergraduate, class of 2028 and went to Montgomery Blair HS in Maryland. I love designing and building cool stuff!
                    I hope that some of that passion can be seen through this portfolio! </p>
                <p>I orginally had a major interest in computer sceince but have fallen in love with the more mechanical side of things at college.
                    I am pursuing a major in Mechanical Engineering with Electrical Engineering with the goal to pursue some future in robotics!
                    The projects I'm working on and plan to work on are to build experience with systems and techniques I haven't used before, and have fun of course!
                </p>
                <p>Outside of classes and robotics, I've grown a passion for glass lampworking and have been making many small glass sculptures, mostly flowers.
                    I also love rock climbing and play video games from time to time.
                </p>
